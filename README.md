# Cube-Solver-and-Guide

Using proper cube notation, allows proper rotations of a Rubik's cube from any dimension starting at 2, going up to 7 (you can input more than one move at a time as well).
Also has the ability to generate and apply legal WCA (World Cube Association) scrambles for cubes of the aforementioned dimensions.
Built-in Rubik's cube solver for dimensions 2 and 3 so far.
Future plans on adding graphics through OpenGL software. Currently, displays cube's 6 faces as text with each letter representing the colors as follows: White (W), Yellow (Y), Orange (O), Green (G), Blue (B), Red (R).
